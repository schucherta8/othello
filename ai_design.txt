My AI is pretty dumb. It chooses a random legal spot. I have my ai scan the
whole board first. It would only run legal moves function on empty spots 
adjacent to stones. It would then process those empty spots to find which ones
were actually legal moves. Once it determined which spots were legal it would 
store them in a list. Then it would random choose a spot from the list. I
usually beat it, but every once in a while it plays some smart moves. I would
improve my AI by determining the most stones it could flip. Then always choose
that legal move. Probably use a distance forumla to calculate it. Kind of like
in centroids except pick the furtherest distance.
